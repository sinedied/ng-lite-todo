# ðŸª¶ ng-lite-todo

> Todo-list app built with (minimal) Angular.

See this [dev.to article](WIP) to see all details about how this app was created.

## Tasks

This starter is used the same way as any Angular project, ie using the included NPM scripts or the Angular CLI directly:

- `npm start`: run dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`
- `npm run build`: build the project in the `dist/` directory.
